# Blackbird.io Sitecore XP

Blackbird is the new automation backbone for the language technology industry. Blackbird provides enterprise-scale automation and orchestration with a simple no-code/low-code platform. Blackbird enables ambitious organizations to identify, vet and automate as many processes as possible. Not just localization workflows, but any business and IT process. This repository represents an application that is deployable on Blackbird and usable inside the workflow editor.

## Introduction

<!-- begin docs -->

Sitecore is one of the leading enterprise-level content management systems, enabling web content editors and marketers to have full control over all aspects of their website from social integration and blog posts to advanced personalisation, ecommerce and more. This app focusses on the integration between Sitecore items, languages and the rest of the Blackbird ecosystem. Contrary to other Blackbird apps, in order to get up and running you need to install a custom-built plugin on your Sitecore instance.

This app is built for Sitecore XP. For Sitecore XM Cloud see [this guide](https://docs.blackbird.io/apps/sitecore-xm-cloud/) instead.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have access to an instance of Sitecore XP.
- You have sufficient administrator access in Sitecore to install a plugin.
- You have downloaded the latest Blackbird Sitecore plugin package from [here](https://docs.blackbird.io/sitecore/package.zip).

## Installing the plugin

1. On the 'Desktop' Navigate to the installation wizzard.

## Actions

- **Search items** finds items based on your search criteria, including last updated, created, language, path, etc.
- **Get all configured languages** returns all the languages that are configured in this Sitecore instance.
- **Get item content as HTML** get the content of an item represented as an HTML file so that it can be processed by NMT or TMS. You can specify which version/language should be retrieved.
- **Update item content from HTML** updates the content of a specific version/language. Additionally, you can choose to always create a new version.
- **Delete item content** deletes an item.
- **Get Item ID from HTML** retrieves the item ID from the HTML content. When you receive translated HTML content we will add the Item ID to the header of HTML file, this action allows you to receive the Item ID from the HTML document.

## Events

- **On items created** triggers when new items are created.
- **On items updated** triggers when any item is updated.

## Example

This example shows how one could retrieve a subset of items, based on custom criteria, download these items HTML files, translate them using any NMT provider and update the translations.
